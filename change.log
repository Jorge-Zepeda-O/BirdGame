~~~~~~ Nov 30, 2020 v2 ~~~~~~
= Made Peeps rounder
= Minor changes to resource descriptions to incorporate more references

x Visual bug causing everything to appear when it's not supposed to (Forgot to add in bootstrap)

~~~~~~ Nov 30, 2020 ~~~~~~
Feature additions:
+ New resources! (Some currently without assets)
+ More resource upgrades! (Needs some balancing and testing)
+ Increased Peep caps!
+ New ways to get resources! (I'm looking at you, Knowledge)
+ Introduced carry mechanic, which fundamentally multiplies production across a resource type
+ Little information tidbits for each resource
+ Introduced assignment multipliers (1x, 5x, 20x)
+ Peeps have a mind of their own
+ Resource conversions now exist and happen on their own if there are idle Peeps
+ Town buildings
+ New Peeps (Currently they all behave the same)
+ Rare easter egg

Balance or gameplay updates:
= When out of focus, the game compensates for the down time
= Fundamentally altered resource production mechanics
= Rebalanced resource production, upgrades, and capacities (and their costs)
= Resource capacity is now based on total units rather than total value
= Consuming resources uses least valuable first, but will also consume whole units of more valuable resources.
= Restructured a lot of code
= Lots of UI changes
= Added a verbosity toggle for more information
= Knowledge has temporary and permanent forms now. Permanent resources are obviously slow to acquire.

Bugfixes:
x Housing/Capacity upgrades not being green when available for purchase
x When loading, if you have a resource at the maximum capacity, the game does not attribute that resource to you.
x Books were not working before... they work now.
x Fixed Peeps moonwalking (but they still walk in the sky)
